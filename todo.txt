Step 1) Get trading bot working (Do drop percentages to buy at dip)
Step 2) Display trades on website
Step 3) add interactivity with bot from website
    - add live view of trades
    - add option to send crypto to the portfolio as donation
Step 4) Query data using MySQL
Step 5) Get better trades going using algorithm (ML?)



ML Idea:
-Use predicting crypto algorithm to write predictions to a txt file
-Have main bot program read from the prediction txt file to make purchases
